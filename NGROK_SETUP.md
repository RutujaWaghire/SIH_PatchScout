# üåç Share Over Internet - ngrok Setup Guide

Your friend is **NOT on the same Wi-Fi**, so we'll use **ngrok** to create a public tunnel.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Download ngrok

1. Go to: **https://ngrok.com/download**
2. Click **"Download for Windows"**
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., `C:\ngrok\`)

---

### Step 2: Sign Up (Free)

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup**
2. Sign up with Google/GitHub (fastest) or email
3. After signup, you'll see your **Authtoken** on the dashboard

---

### Step 3: Configure ngrok

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to where you extracted ngrok
cd C:\ngrok

# Add your authtoken (replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token from dashboard)
.\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

**Example:**
```powershell
.\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken 2abc123def456ghi789jkl0mno1pqr2s3t4u5v6w7x8y9z
```

---

### Step 4: Start ngrok Tunnel

Keep your servers running, then in a **NEW PowerShell window**:

```powershell
cd C:\ngrok
.\ngrok.exe http 8080
```

You'll see output like this:
```
ngrok

```

---

### Step 5: Share the Link!

**Look for the "Forwarding" line** and copy the **https** URL.

**Example:** `https://abc123xyz.ngrok-free.app`

**Send this link to your friend!** They can access it from anywhere in the world! üåç

## üì± Message to Send Your Friend

```
Hey! Check out my security scanner project:

üîó https://abc123xyz.ngrok-free.app
(Replace with YOUR actual ngrok URL)

This works from anywhere - no need to be on my network!

Try:
- Dashboard (view security stats)
- Scanner tab (scan: scanme.nmap.org)
- AI Assistant (ask security questions)
- Analyzer (view vulnerability reports)

Note: The link only works while I'm running the servers.
Let me know what you think! üöÄ
```

## üéØ Complete PowerShell Commands

### Terminal 1: Backend (Already Running)
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Atharv Danave\Downloads\intellivuln-hub-main\intellivuln-hub-main\backend"
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Terminal 2: Frontend (Already Running)
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Atharv Danave\Downloads\intellivuln-hub-main\intellivuln-hub-main"
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
npm run dev
```

### Terminal 3: ngrok (NEW - Run This Now)
```powershell
cd C:\ngrok
.\ngrok.exe http 8080
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "command not found"
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the ngrok folder:
```powershell
cd C:\ngrok
.\ngrok.exe http 8080
```

### Problem: "authentication required"
**Solution:** Add your authtoken:
```powershell
.\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_FROM_DASHBOARD
```

### Problem: Backend API not working
**Solution:** You need to tunnel BOTH ports. See "Advanced Setup" below.

---

## üöÄ Advanced Setup (If Backend Issues)

If your friend sees the website but features don't work, you need to tunnel the backend too.

### Option 1: Use ngrok Free Plan (2 Tunnels)

**Terminal 3: Frontend Tunnel**
```powershell
cd C:\ngrok
.\ngrok.exe http 8080
```

**Terminal 4: Backend Tunnel (NEW)**
```powershell
cd C:\ngrok
.\ngrok.exe http 8000
```

You'll get TWO URLs:
- Frontend: `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`
- Backend: `https://def456.ngrok-free.app`

### Option 2: Update Frontend to Use ngrok Backend

If features don't work, you may need to update the API URL in the frontend.

**Don't worry about this unless your friend reports issues!**
